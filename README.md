# TPCODL Scrapper
Tired with the power cuts in your area (Yes, I am!), then a tool built for me and people like me..

## Capability 
It scraps the TPCODL website for the power cuts in my area and display it in the form of a JSON array. Thats it.

### How to run?
1. Make a new venv `uv venv --python 3.12` and activate it. 
2. Install the deps `uv sync`.
3. Just run the `main.py` python file.
